# Music Genre Classification using Machine Learning

![Spectrogram Example](images/spectogram.png)

## Project Overview
The main objective of this project is to challenge myself and expand my skill set. Initially, the focus will be on understanding audio signals and identifying the characteristics that differentiate one genre from another. The goal is to develop a machine learning model capable of effectively predicting the genre of any given song.

In later stages, I plan to compare this initial classification with a neural network model trained on classical visual representations of audio signals, such as waveforms and spectrograms. Additionally, I may explore natural language extraction and processing to further enhance the model's capabilities.

This project is a space for experimentation and learning. I will document each step of the process, highlighting key challenges and the new knowledge I acquire along the way.
